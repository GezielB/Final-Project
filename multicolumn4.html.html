			Demon Slayer is a show that came out of nowhere with so many anime and manga releases but the visuals of this anime is one of the major things that stands out.

				After many animes in my book I've never seen a show with so much detail and colors. The first season blew me away not only with the story but the visuals.

				<h2>What you can learn</h2>
				<p>
			   If there is enough money and interest backing a show or anime more money can be spent on it and beautiful results will come out.
			   This isn't always possible but they certainly spent on Demon Slayer and it paid off.

				<h2>It's not just the visuals</h2>
				<p>
				The visuals are a huge part for the success in my opinion but the story is also very engaging and entertaining. Of course if this wasn't the case nobody would even care to watch no matter the quality.

				<h2>In summary</h2>
				
				<p>
				As you can tell from many of these pictures the quality is incredible! This mixed with an awesome story, you have a great anime that I would call top 5 of all time.
