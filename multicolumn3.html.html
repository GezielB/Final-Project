			DBZ the long time icon is for sure in my top 5 of all time not only because it's a great show but it's the main series I grew up with as a kid. That creates a stronger liking and care for a series which to this date is still going strong. It surely has it's flaws but at this point it's more about the history and bond you have with it than the story itself.

				<h2>Does he have too many transformations?</h2>
				<p>
				 To be honest he may or may not have too many transformations and I love it. While other animes can base their stories on mystery or very complex story telling, DBZ is more of a get stronger and battle anime. 
				 If you've been a fan of the series you know what to expect and it's the way it's done and how it happens that always gives you the same feeling of awe.

				<h2>Is it only transformations?</h2>
				
				<p>
				No, this show has a lot of heart and a great mix of seriousness with a bit of comedy thrown in. Itâ€™s an awesome show primarily due to its thrilling blend of high-stakes battles, deep character development, and a rich, expansive universe that feels both vast and intimately familiar. Each character, from Goku to Vegeta, undergoes significant growth, facing challenges that test their limits and forge their spirits. The action sequences are unparalleled, with choreography and power displays that are both visually stunning and emotionally charged, keeping me on the edge of my seat. 
				Beyond the fights, the storylines are woven with themes of friendship, perseverance, and redemption, resonating deeply with my personal values. Lastly, the show's ability to mix humor with drama, all while exploring the complexity of its characters and their relationships, solidifies "Dragon Ball Z" as one of my all-time favorite shows.
