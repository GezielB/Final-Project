			This show brought me back into the world of anime and reignited my passion for all things geeky. One day, while I was relaxing, my brother came up to me and suggested I check out a new anime that had just started its second season. 
			I started watching the show and was hooked from the very first episode. It was more than enough to catch my attention and pique my interest.

				<h2>Why did this anime bring me back?</h2>

				For a while anime had become in my opinion more of a childish thing and I wasn't aware of anime that got as serious and intense as Attack on Titan at the time.				
				</p>
				
				<blockquote>
				My soldiers, rage! My soldiers, scream! My soldiers, fight!
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>
				This is a quote from Erwin Smith who was the leader of the squad in charge  of defending the civilians from enemies outside of the walls. He said this as he knew he'd be facing demise along with his comrades while showing no fear. These types of momments are very impactful as it shows the type of sacrifices people can make on a day to day basis and it makes your realize that there are very brave people out there.
				The scene and episode are very inpirational which is a huge thing for me as it's not just a show that gives you action scenes to whoah you away.

				<h2>Much more to it</h2>
				<p>
				This show has great scenes and moments, but it took over 15 years for the manga to be brought into anime and be finished. The story progressed through the years and there were lots of mystery and questions left unanswered until the last few episodes. This story is something I've never experienced before and just when you think you got closer to an answer things change. 
				The writer is a true master of his work and developed the story in a complex but straightforward way.

				<h2>Characters</h2>
				<p>
				Aside from the compelling story all the characters in this anime seemed to matter and it's something not many shows can make you feel. They were all flushed out very well and had a thing unique to them in one way or another.
				The list to my right can be a bit controversial but one of the main characters is not even in my top 5 because the side characters were all so good.

					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>
					This may or may not have been a great read but I tried my best to show and tell you why this show is my all time favorite. Even above the iconic Dragon Ball Z which in itself is an amazing show as well.
