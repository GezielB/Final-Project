			<h2>The anime that is almost too ridiculous</h2>
			<img src ="https://images.alphacoders.com/670/670899.jpg" alt="a poster featuring many animes in a poster format" class="feature-pic">
			<p class="feature-text">
			The anime in question walks a fine line between not taking itself seriously enough to be considered good, but the strength of its writing makes up for it. 
			While it may seem unrealistic that one character can defeat all of his opponents with a single punch, this flaw can be overlooked due to the compelling nature of the story.

				<h2>What makes it great?</h2>
				
				<p>
				Even though there is 1 character who at the current point of the story can defeat anybody as fast as he wants. They still provide tension, action, excitement and many other great story elements.				
				</p>
			
				<h2>
				Here are a few reasons why this show is great
				</h2>
					<h3>
					 Innovative Parody of Superhero Tropes:
					</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>One Punch Man parodies superhero and shonen anime. The protagonist, Saitama, can defeat any opponent with a single punch, subverting the typical tension of battle-centric anime. This leads to humorous critiques of genre norms.</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>
					 Engaging Characters and Development: 
					</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Saitama's invincibility is balanced by a diverse cast of characters with their own growth arcs.</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>
					 Stunning Animation and Battle Sequences:
					</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Madhouse, the studio responsible for the first season of "One Punch Man," is widely recognized for its exceptional animation quality. The show's fight scenes are impressively choreographed, fluid, and dynamic. Despite Saitama's overwhelming strength, each battle is a memorable visual spectacle, creative and beautifully executed.</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>
					 Humor and Satire:
					</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The humor is one of One Punch Man's greatest assets. By exaggerating superhero fights and Saitama's mundane problems, the show delivers a unique comedic style that remains engaging.</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>
					 Philosophical and Existential Themes:
					</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>One Punch Man explores themes of strength, boredom, and purpose. Saitama's journey is a metaphor for finding purpose in life beyond traditional challenges.</li>
						</ul>

				<h2>One the biggest takeaways</h2>
					<p>
					The main character and strongest guy Saitama doesn't look for friends or allies but he seems to get other super strong people to befriend him all the time.
					So it adds even more to the story seeing rivals just be in awe with his power and end up gaining respect for him.
